            <p>When setting a dinner table, the silverware and plates are already placed for you, however, depending on the meal being eaten, the types of utensils used can vary for person to person. Especially in South Asian culture, the served food can be eaten with or without utensils. It does not even matter if a spoon or fork is being used at certain times, so it leads to everyone having their own preference.

        <p>Prestige is a product that gives the guest that preference. Not only does it beautify the dinning table, it honors the guest by granting them the ability to choose their silverware.
        </p>

        <p> In addition to that, it effectively organizes the silverware at both ends of the table and even leaves room for decorative elements, like flowers, near the middle. And then to top it off, the middle can be used for food, like appetizers. </p>
